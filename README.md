# Project-Computational-Science
Code for project computational science team 8

In this project, we model traffic accidents, EMS vehicles and hospital EMS coverage in the province of Flevoland.
To run this code, you need a Google maps API key, as well as the CBS data on traffic casualties in Flevoland.
An API key can be obtained through the google cloud environment. At the start of the code, this key should be
pasted at "your key here".
